<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I enjoy making stories and looking up facts that I can tell my family about.I also read alot and love going to school.
Not just to see my friends but learn new things and sometimes the teachers make really fun lessons to teach us and have 
fun.I have got this book called "encycolpedia of amazing facts" and I found it a joy to read.I also hae been doing this 
HTML course and I have found it really helpful to learn how to type HTML.

<p>I love spending time with my family whether it's a movie night or shopping.Playing games with my cousin(Lucy)is really
  fun because we play games,crochette,make braclets and have sleepovers.Me and my grandma love drawing and watching tv 
together.Me and my antie have had lots of sleepovers and play board games.(my favourite boardgame is tapple.) </p>

<p>I surprisingly like to bake.Sometimes when I have a sleepover,in the morning,we make pancakes.Later on in the day,we 
if we're able,we make cake.every once in a while, my grandma,antie,sister and me go to Elsmear Port
